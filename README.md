# Start of lab2
A repo to play with the common git operations in.

Steps to complete for the in class activity

- Place that change on line number 7
- Ensure that you keep it in the same bulleted list

# Look at how this turns into a heading
This is called Markdown. Markdown is a very simple format that involves adding special keyboard characters before thing to change the meaning of how it should be presented
## Notice that this is a heading
It's because I used two `##` with a space and that changes `Notice that this is a heading`. Also the tilda key (top left row ~) has a tick mark which can be used to do that minor formatting you see on this
### Sub heading
You can get even deeper headings
#### Ever smaller heading
And now this is just getting silly

Let's add a link.
